## Description
The "COVID-19 Data Exploration" project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis aimed at examining various aspects of the 
[COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths#explore-the-global-data-on-confirmed-covid-19-deaths).
owid-covid-data.xlsx excel file is the original data file which got split into two separate files covid-death-data and covid-vaccination-data.
Data from these excel files are imorted in SQL Server Management Studio and used for this project.
Using SQL skills including joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, 
window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and data type conversions, this project looks into pandemic's impact.

## Objectives:
1. Data Retrieval and Exploration:
Utilizing SQL queries to extract and explore COVID-19 data from multiple tables.
Investigating parameters such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, and population to understand the dynamics of the pandemic.

2. Analysis of Case and Death Statistics:
Calculating metrics such as death percentage, infection rates compared to population, and identifying countries with the highest infection and death counts.
Examining specific countries (e.g., Latvia) to assess the likelihood of mortality and the percentage of the population affected by the virus.

3. Regional and Global Insights:
Segmenting data by continents and regions to discern trends and variations in death counts.
Aggregating global statistics to provide insights into the overall impact of COVID-19 on a global scale.

4. Vaccination Analysis:
Integrating vaccination data to analyze the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
Calculating rolling vaccination counts and percentages to assess the progress of vaccination efforts across different locations.
                                          
## Key Skills Demonstrated:
**SQL Querying:** Proficiency in writing complex SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data from relational databases.

**Data Manipulation:** Employing advanced SQL techniques such as joins, window functions, and aggregate functions to perform calculations and derive insights.

**Data Visualization Preparation:** Creating views to encapsulate specific datasets for visualization and further analysis.
